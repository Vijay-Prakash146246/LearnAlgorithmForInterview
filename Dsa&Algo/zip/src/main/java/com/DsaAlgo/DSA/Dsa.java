Data Structure :-

It is used to store and organize data.It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

Data structure:-
1. Linear Data Structure: In it data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

1.1 Static Data Structure: It has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. Example: array.
1.2 Dynamic Data Structure: In it, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space)
 complexity of the code. Example: Queue, Stack, link-list etc.

 2.Non-Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.
 In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. Examples: Trees and Graphs.

 Array Data Structure:-
 1.Search, Insert, and Delete in an Unsorted Array | Array Operations
